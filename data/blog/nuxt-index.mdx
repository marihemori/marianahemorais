Nuxt.js is a framework for creating Vue.js applications.

It is a framework that helps Vue.js applications to be developed faster, easier and more organized.

It supports:

- Server side rendering
- Static generation
- Meta tags
- Code splitting
- Server side redering (SSR)

It means that a code will be processed on a server and will send the response to your browser.

## Positive points:

- SEO optimized
- Performance
- Pre redering
- The .html files are created upfront(Then the production folder will contain a .html file, for each page of the application. It is interesting for applications of few pages.
  )

- Host for free
- Code splitting(It is a technique that splits the Javascript code into several files.)
- Speed
- Low cost(Nuxt will automatically create a Javascript file for weach page, and will take care of the dependecies.)
